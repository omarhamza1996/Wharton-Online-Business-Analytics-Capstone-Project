## Developing a Strategy for GoYaFace, Inc. to Counter the Impact of Adblockers
**Project Description:** 

In the capstone project for the Business Analytics Specialization by Wharton Online, I developed a comprehensive strategy for a fictional digital search engine and content provider, GoYaFace, Inc. (GYF). This project aimed to address the challenges posed by the increasing popularity and use of adblocking software, which significantly impacts GYF’s revenue generated from advertisements.

**Problem Statement:** 

The project commenced with an in-depth analysis of the implications of adblockers for GYF’s ad-buying customers, end users, operations, and internal organization. Key issues identified included reduced ad visibility, decreased ROI for advertisers, low click-through rates, and eroded trust between GYF and its advertisers. Additionally, adblockers negatively affect user experience, content quality, and GYF’s financial health.

## Based on this I have written this Business Analytics Capstone project framework for Strategy Please see the PDF file to see my work.
