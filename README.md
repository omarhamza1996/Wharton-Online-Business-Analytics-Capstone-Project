# Wharton-Online-Business-Analytics-Capstone-Project
## Developing a Strategy for GoYaFace, Inc. to Counter the Impact of Adblockers
**Project Description:** 

In the capstone project for the Business Analytics Specialization by Wharton Online, I developed a comprehensive strategy for a fictional digital search engine and content provider, GoYaFace, Inc. (GYF). The focus of this project was to address the challenges posed by the increasing popularity and use of adblocking software, which significantly impacts GYF’s revenue generated from advertisements.

**Problem Statement:** 

The project commenced with an in-depth analysis of the implications of adblockers for GYF’s ad-buying customers, end users, operations, and internal organization. Key issues identified included reduced ad visibility, decreased ROI for advertisers, low click-through rates, and eroded trust between GYF and its advertisers. Additionally, adblockers negatively affect user experience, content quality, and GYF’s financial health.

**Research Methods and Tools:**

To develop a robust strategy, I employed descriptive and causal research methods. Tools utilized included mobile surveys, A/B testing, price testing, and advanced data analytics to understand user preferences, evaluate new strategies, and monitor ad performance.

**Strategy Development:**

* **The proposed strategy encompassed several key initiatives:**

* **User-Friendly Ad Formats:** Leveraged insights from mobile surveys to create less intrusive ad formats, enhancing user engagement and reducing adblocker usage.
Anti-Adblocker Technology: Implemented technologies to detect and counteract adblockers, increasing ad visibility and performance metrics.
Proprietary Web Browser: Developed a web browser to control ad delivery and combat ad-blocking software, allowing user-based ad preference customization.
Enhanced User Experience: Continuously improved user experience using data from social media analytics and user feedback.
Strengthened Advertiser Relationships: Provided detailed analytics and insights to advertisers, demonstrating the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Alternative Revenue Streams: Explored subscription models and premium content to diversify GYF’s revenue sources.
Anticipated Effects:

Increased User Engagement: Enhanced ad interaction and higher click-through rates due to user-friendly ad formats.
Reduced Adblocker Usage: Less intrusive ads resulted in lower adblocker usage and improved overall campaign effectiveness.
Higher Revenue: Preserved and potentially increased ad revenue through effective anti-adblocker measures.
Enhanced Data Collection: Richer data on user behavior enabled more targeted and effective advertising strategies.
Improved Advertiser Trust: Strengthened relationships with advertisers through transparent communication and improved ad performance.
Diversified Income: Reduced dependency on traditional ad revenue and created sustainable growth through new monetization strategies.
Measurement Plan:

To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, I established key performance indicators (KPIs) for each initiative. These included ad engagement rates, user feedback scores, ad visibility rates, revenue recovery rates, browser adoption rates, user satisfaction scores, and subscription conversion rates. Continuous data monitoring, correlation and regression analysis, and controlled experiments were employed to validate the success of the strategies and make necessary adjustments in real-time.

Conclusion:

The comprehensive strategy devised for GYF aimed to mitigate the adverse effects of adblockers, enhance user experience, maintain advertiser satisfaction, and explore new revenue streams. By systematically measuring the outcomes and adapting strategies as needed, GYF can remain resilient and competitive in the digital advertising landscape.
